## How to read the ladder
* The expectations at each level are cumulative.
* Managers have the same expectations as individual contributors to the extent that they are doing individual work, in addition to manager-specific expectations

## Pro tips
* Dex and Str (the "adder" attributes) are the primary drivers of promotions at lower levels. At higher levels, the importance gradually shifts to Wis and Cha (the "multiplier" attributes).
* Not everyone will progress in each column in lockstep. If you are Dex:6/Cha:3, you will not be stuck at L3, but you will likely not be promoted all the way L6.
